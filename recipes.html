                <p class="description">
                    This beverage is typically made using one or two shots of espresso, topped-up with steamed milk, and
                    finished with a small layer of foam on top.

                        <li>Espresso or strongly brewed coffee</li>
                        <li>2% or nonfat milk</li>

                    <p>
                        Make your espresso or strongly brewed coffee.
                        Pour milk into the jar. Fill no more than halfway. Screw the lid on tightly, and shake the
                        jar as hard as you can until the milk is frothy and has roughly doubled in volume.
                        Take the lid off the jar and microwave uncovered for 30 seconds.
                        Pour the espresso or coffee into a wide, shallow coffee cup.
                        Spoon as much milk foam as you would like onto your latte.

                <h3>Cold Brew</h3>

                <p class="description">
                    Coffee that’s brewed with room temperature or cold water over a longer period of time.
                </p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Make Cold Brew:</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 ounces coarsely-ground coffee </li>
                        <li>3 cups water (filtered water if you have it)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In a 1-quart wide-mouth mason jar, combine the coffee and water. Stir to combine. Put a lid
                        on your container and refrigerate it for 12 to 18 hours. When you’re ready to strain your
                        cold brew, place a thin paper coffee filter or a small, thin cotton napkin or handkerchief
                        over a small fine-mesh sieve. Pour the concentrate through the prepared sieve into a liquid
                        measuring cup or pitcher. Let it rest for a few minutes to let the last of the cold brew
                        trickle down. To serve, fill a glass with ice and fill it halfway with water. Then fill the
                        rest of the glass with cold brew concentrate, and stir to combine. Cold brew concentrate
                        will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
